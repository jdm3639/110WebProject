        <h3 class="effectivityColor">What is nostalgia?</h3>
        <p>
            Nostalgia is a set of emotions, usually positive
            ones, elicited from our memories. Furthermore, this 'nostalgic media' hones on significant past
            events, places, songs, art styles, clothing styles, etc. in hopes of triggering nostalgia.

            Take a look at the TV show "Stranger Things";
            it's filled with 80's themed elements and which is, no doubt, a big contributor to its success due
            to the nostalgic effect it has on its viewers.
            <br><br>
            However, this idea of nostalgic media is nothing new.
            “Happy Days”

            is a television sitcom created by Garry Marshall in 1974. The show focused on a
            culture and period of time that would be relevant and meaningful for a generation of people
            growing up in the 1950s. Happy Days idolized iconic cultural hallmarks in a time of leather
            jackets, diners, drive-in movies, and fashion representative of America youth culture in the
            1950s. In large part, the success of this sitcom was a direct result of drawing viewership from
            nostalgic experiences.

            We can also see its footprints leaking into the gaming industry with things like the release of World of
            Warcraft Classic, an
            official release of an older version of the game from 2006, alongside the revival of older
            retro-styled games.
