        <h3 class="effectivityColor">What causes nostalgia?</h3>
        <p>
            A longing for a past culture.
            <blockquote>
                "Coping with media change is the modus operandi in societies shaped by an
                ongoing media saturation of everyday lifeworlds. However, demands to participate in media
                change are sometimes perceived as challenging. In this regard, media nostalgia, understood as
                the longing for past media culture and technology, is introduced as a resource to cope with
                media change."

        <h3 class="effectivityColor">Why has nostalgic media gotten more popular recently?</h3>

            With technology growing and expanding at incredible rates in the last 30 years,
            the 'coping generation' would affect people who grew up in the 80s or earlier. This could explain
            why elements from the '80s have shown up in a lot of modern pop culture and media.

        <h3 class="effectivityColor">History of nostalgic waves</h3>
        <p>
            In the 1970s a man of the name Fred
            Davis studied the current wave of nostalgia happening during that time
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "in modern history the common man had his fundamental, taken for-granted convictions about
            man, woman, habits, manners, laws, society and God . . . so challenged, disrupted and shaken"
            <br><span class="historyColor">Fred Davis</span> (1977)
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            In other
            words, whether it's from too much of a technological tear or cultural tear, a nostalgia wave
            follows with the wave proportional to the size of the tear in the two societies.

        <h3 class="bibliographyColor">So, how will nostalgic media impact our culture?</h3>
        <p>
            
            We can continue to expect nostalgic-driven content in our media and products. Nostalgia is and will continue
            be a substantial theme in modern media, mainly
            because of its proven ability to illicit an emotional, somewhat subliminal, response from
            consumers, drawing them in and leveraging sales opportunities to its maximum potential.
